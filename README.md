# leetcode
This is a place to implement leetcode problems and write them up.

## Purpose
This is to sharpen up for interviews, as well as learn new languages

## Guidelines
1. Start an issue with a leetcode link
2. Clone and make a new branch
3. Create a folder if it does not already exist. Convention is just the name of
   the problem with the number. I.E. "226. Invert Binary Tree" ->
   `226-invert-binary-tree`
3. Implement your solution.
4. Create a markdown document that explains the problem, if you feel it warrants
   an explanation.
5. Make a PR and reference the issue
